# Scaled Agile Framework - What is it and how do you use it? [OUTLINE - v1]

- Introduce the term scaled agile framework (`SAFe`) as an agile software development framework by Scaled Agile, Inc.
- Highlight the basic benefits according to proponents of `SAFe`, such as scalability and modularity.
- Emphasize the purpose of this article: to cover exactly what `SAFe` is, how it is typically implemented, as well as advantages and disadvantages of the methodology throughout the software development life cycle.

## What is Scaled Agile Framework?

- Discuss the key tenets of `SAFe` methodology (incremental builds, economic view, utilize knowledge of workers, etc).
- Emphasize the reliance of `SAFe` on `Lean` and `Agile` principles.
- Outline how `SAFe` attempts to meet both development and business goals.
- Detail what [`a release train`](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/agile-release-train/) is (`ART`) in the world of `SAFe`, and what role it plays.

- Detail how `SAFe` is _arguably_ [free of charge](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/usage-and-permissions/), though any help with implementation is charged.
- Provides specific, tangible advice for implementing software development practices.
- Best suited for large organizations with sizeable teams.
- Emphasizes people and skills over technology.
- Aims to support teams which exist for more than one project.
